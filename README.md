- E-commerce site - sneakers shop.
- School project.

#### Created with: 
- Front-end: HTML, SASS and JavaScript.
- For products data used Strapi (for images connected with Cloudinary), deployed to Heroku and MongoDB used as database. 

Login option is available for admin panel where you can edit, add new and delete products (route is protected if user is not logged in).
Some options are limited because of the difference between design and values returned from API (like color and size).
Last step is add or remove from cart. Checkout of course is not available. 

It's a little slow with getting data from Heroku (but it's free :) )
