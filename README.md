-E-commerce site - sneakers shop.
-School project.

## Created with: 
-Front-end: HTML, SASS and JavaScript.
-For products data used Strapi (for images connected with Cloudinary), deployed to Heroku and MongoDB used as database. 

It's a little slow with getting data from Heroku (but it's free :) )
